## Inspiration
It is clear that while we have extensively studied renowned inventors like the Wright brothers and Sir Isaac Newton, our educational discourse often overlooks the remarkable contributions of Muslim inventors. Figures such as Abbas ibn Firnas, who achieved flight long before the Wright brothers, remind us that innovation is not confined to any one culture or era. It is crucial to recognize and celebrate these pioneers, as they laid the groundwork for many of the advancements we enjoy today. By highlighting these contributions, we can inspire Muslims to take pride in their rich heritage, reinforcing the idea that it is indeed Muslims who have stood as game changers throughout history. Together, we are trying to embrace this legacy with optimism and confidence in our potential to shape the future.

## What it does
This innovative prototype offers an engaging way to explore notable landmarks on the map while uncovering the rich histories of Muslim scholars who once resided there. Users can expect a wealth of information and fascinating stories that bring the past to life. The prototype features two distinct modes: the Educational Mode, which allows users to learn in-depth about the provided content, and the Mission Mode, which adds an exciting challenge. In Mission Mode, users can navigate through different regions, completing tasks and earning tokens to unlock new areas for further exploration. This engaging experience not only educates but also motivates users to delve deeper into the world of Muslim scholarship and heritage.

## What's next for Trailblazers
We are excited to introduce a new feature that will enhance the learning experience for our users! At the conclusion of each lesson, we will offer engaging quizzes that not only reinforce what theyâ€™ve learned but also make the learning experience more interactive and fun. To foster a sense of community and healthy competition, we plan to implement a regional and eventually a global leaderboard. This way, users can track their progress and see how they stack up against others, creating motivation and encouraging continuous improvement. Furthermore, we are committed to elevating the overall app experience by introducing a monthly subscription option. This subscription will unlock even more immersive content, allowing users to dive deeper into the richness of our Islamic heritage. We believe these enhancements will not only enrich knowledge but also foster a robust community of learners. We are confident that these steps will inspire our users and bring them even closer to their goals!
